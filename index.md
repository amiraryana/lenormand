# (2) The Clover 🃆

  - Luck
  - Lightheartedness
  - Small Happinesses
  - Opportunity
  - Being Untroubled
  - Comedy

To find the Clover in a Lenormand reading (and in real life) is usually a sign of a happy coincidence of some sort. It is associated with luck and opportunities, though ones that are not too significant in nature.
We associate the Clover card with life’s small joys - which are usually fleeting, passing by at a moment’s notice. Therefore, the Clover is also indicative of something that we must take quick action to reap the benefits of. You’ve only got a short window to make use of this chance\!

This card also lends a feeling of lightheartedness and humor to any situation. When things in life are fleeting and ever-changing, whether the situations are positive and negative, we can learn to not take them too seriously. Remembering that all things pass can help us lighten up,
but perhaps may also make us take our responsibilities too lightly.
You’ll have to look to the remainder of all your cards in order to interpret this with some accuracy.

  - What opportunities can I act on?
  - Where in life can you stand to be a bit more lighthearted?
  - Where in life can I take things more seriously?
  - How can I appreciate life’s small joys more?

# (3) The Ship 🂪

  - Departure
  - Farewell
  - Distance
  - Voyage
  - Travel
  - Journey
  - Adventure

At the heart of the Ship card is the concept of travel, of journeys and all that one experiences during it. It can very well mean taking a trip of some kind to a far off place, but it can also signify the mental state of travel - the desire to see new places, to explore and to voyage into the unknown. Regardless of whether you are actually, physically making a journey, this card signals heading out on an adventure of some sort - where you are going far from what is familiar.

This card can also imply distance to its surrounding cards, sometimes concerning long-distance relationships, far away family, or an overseas business trip - depending on your question and the other cards in the spread. This definition too, can also be more metaphorical in nature.
While you may be in close proximity physically to something, you may not feel close to it.

Finally this card can also signal the choice to move away from something. While journeys can be taken in the search for new, unexplored realms, there are times too when we must undertake a journey in order to leave something else behind.

  - Where in life is unexplored for me?
  - With what or with who do I feel distanced from?
  - How can I be more adventurous?
  - What am I looking for?
  - What am I trying to get away from?

# (4) The House 🂾

  - Home
  - Establishment
  - Safety
  - Tradition
  - Custom
  - Privacy
  - Conservation

When the House appears in one’s Lenormand card reading, issues of family and home life are being referenced. It can signal both the physical space, the people within it - such as specific family members, and also the more abstract concept of home. When we think of places that feel like home, they are places where we feel safe, where we feel protected,
where we feel like we belong, where we are comfortable.

This same sense of belonging and comfort, while creating stability and security - can also make it difficult to go forth and try new ways of doing things. The house is a boundary between what is outside and what is inside - it is a bubble or a barrier, something which separates. It implies that there is an “us” and a “them”. This can mean keeping things away from the private eye, but also can translate to the feeling of close-mindedness.

  - Do I feel at home?
  - Where is my home now?
  - How does tradition affect my current situation?
  - How does my family affect my current situation?
  - Where in life can I explore the unknown?

# (5) The Tree 🂷

  - Growth
  - Grounded
  - Past Connection
  - Personal Growth
  - Spirituality
  - Health

This card can comment on a variety of things - though in more general situations, it focuses on wellbeing and health - both in a physical and a spiritual sense. The tree asks us to look at ourselves from a wholistic perspective. Perhaps it is an indication to take a walk with nature.

Our roots lie far back in our pasts, so timing wise, it tends to refer to past events and situations - a current moment grounded in what came before. Like a tree, what is happening today perhaps took quite a bit of time to grow - but what came out of that time created security.

With its many intertwining branches, it also reminds us that we are all connected - and thus the card can also indicate there is a deep bond between two people in a reading.

  - What does your higher self say?
  - How does this help me develop as a human being?
  - From when did this start happening?
  - How do I find connections between myself and others?

# (6) Clouds 🃞

  - Confusion
  - Unclarity
  - Misunderstanding
  - Insecurity
  - Doubt
  - Hidden Secrets

As a metaphor, when clouds are blocking out the sun, we are unable to see the light of truth. A cloud can act as a veil that obscures something; an in a Lenormand reading, the Cloud stands for that which is hidden, and the doubts and confusion caused by lack of clarity.

You might be finding yourself in a moment where you are unsure of what choices you can take, or where you can go. Because you have so little guidelines, you might be feeling lost.

The clouds themselves too, are vapor - never necessarily having a tangible shape; it’s another sense in which clouds in a Lenormand reading can indicate how vagueness creates more misunderstandings.

  - Where do I need to seek clarity?
  - How can I be more direct?
  - What doubts am I having?
  - Where in my life are there misunderstandings?

|Paired Card|Combined Meaning|

|1\. Rider|mixed messages, confusing news|

# (7) The Snake 🃝

  - Desire
  - Seduction
  - Deception
  - Craving
  - Attraction
  - Sexuality
  - Wisdom
  - Forbidden Knowledge

As one of humanity’s most ancient symbols, seeing the Snake in your Lenormand reading can reflect many aspects and faces of this animal.
Desire and craving, or ambition is one of these facets, especially a desire of the sort that very strong, almost consuming. Some of these desires can be harmless, and others, when uncontrolled, can lead to a kind of addiction. There is also the sense that the kind of desire that is represented by the snake is so strong, that incredible determination comes alongside it - sometimes making for an almost single-minded focus.

Another facet of the snake can involve deception - to be specific, the kind of deception that is calculating and self serving, almost manipulative.

Another interpretation of the Snake card in Lenormand that is rarely used, but just as important, is its wisdom and knowledge. While in more traditional interpretations, such as the ones above, it has been plastered with morality, there is a more pure reading of the snake that has none of those value judgements. In other cultures, their intelligence is revered, and sacred, and even in western interpretations, we must remember that it was the snake that brought us truth - though, forbidden truth.

  - Why do I desire the things I do?
  - How far will I go to get that which I desire?
  - What do I desire that is forbidden to me?
  - Is my desire controlling me?

# (8) The Coffin 🃉

  - Ending
  - Dying
  - Funeral
  - Loss
  - Grief
  - Mourning
  - Sadness

The Coffin Lenormand card speaks about loss and all its related hardships - it is about the emotional process and transitions we have to make when something which we hold dear ceases to exist. This Lenormand card indicates that you are going through an ending, and you’ll have to look towards the other cards within the reading to understand what this ending is about; perhaps a state of mind, a relationship, a job, or a deeply held belief.

Alongside loss, comes suffering, and the coffin card can also indicate grief and mourning - a stage that we must go through in order to let something that we’ve lost go. Sometimes, the card can indicate that your progress is stalled because you cannot let go, and properly mourn and release a deep seated pain.

Finally, this card can also indicate burying - we are putting something so deep in the ground that we can never access it again. This card can indicate that you are repressing something; it could be feelings,
wishes, desires, fears - things that perhaps you may feel deep shame or guilt about.

  - What do I have to let go?
  - What haven’t I mourned yet?
  - What am I repressing?
  - How can I move beyond this loss?

# (9) The Bouquet 🂭

  - Flattery
  - Social Life
  - Pleasantness
  - Cordiality
  - Etiquette
  - Politeness
  - Appreciation

Joyful and light social interactions are represented by the Bouquet Lenormand card. This card indicates that we are being presented with some of life’s more pleasant occasions, and we should be taking some time to enjoy them. This card indicates that this is a good chance to develop friendships, reach out, and take pleasure in the kind of happiness that others can bring.

The Bouquet can also be an expression of gratitude and appreciation - it is a token of thanks and recognition that we give to those who support us. This token can be both from sincere feelings, or out of social politeness, or sometimes flattery with a hidden ulterior motive. It is up to the reader and the surrounding cards to determine which face of the Bouquet is present.

  - How is my social life faring?
  - When was the last time I showed appreciation for those that care for
    me?
  - Who should I reach out to?
  - Are my friendships sincere?

# (10) The Scythe 🃋

  - Accidents
  - Hasty Decisions
  - Danger
  - A Warning
  - Speed
  - Reckoning

You’ll have to be on the lookout for something when you see the Scythe card appear in a Lenormand reading. A sudden ending is on the horizon,
and it will most likely come without warning or expectation - though we must remember that all endings are not necessarily harmful ones. The ending will most likely be swift, and signal a clear break - and what occurs can also lead to lasting effects.

On a more symbolic level, the Scythe represents harvesting - a time when we are reaping the rewards (or punishments) of our past actions. It can mean a moment of taking stock of what we have accomplished, of self-judgement and reckoning. We must look backward to understand what we can best do to move forward and learn from what has been completed.
Therefore, the Scythe can also signal a closure in that sense.

  - What is something that I must let go of?
  - How can I prepare better for sudden changes?
  - What should I look back on?
  - What changes should I make going forward?

# (11) The Whip 🃛

  - Conflict
  - Discussions
  - Arguments
  - Debate
  - Scolding
  - Opposition
  - Objection

The Whip Lenormand card is an indicator of conflict, of arguments and aggression. As a symbol, it has a long history of being used as a form of punishment and abuse. Usually, this card will indicate some kind of verbal disagreement - when two different modes of thinking collide.
During more heated episodes, arguments can turn personal, meaning that this card can also stand for insults and personal attacks. In rare instances, the Whip Lenormand card can also stand for abuse of a physical kind too.

The Whip Lenormand card can also stand for any kind of destructive behavior that is fueled by negativity - sometimes the card exists to show that the motivations behind actions are to simply cause another person pain. This card can be a stand in for the suffering that we receive from others.

Taking it a step further, when one undergoes the suffering for so long,
we can internalize the messages of the Whip card - it can become a form of self-punishment. We can carry with us deep feelings of shame and guilt, that leads us to a cycle of self-hatred.

  - Where in my life is there too much conflict?
  - Is there anyone who is purposely trying to cause me pain?
  - Where in my life am I holding onto deep shame?
  - How can I stand up for myself more?

# (12) Birds 🃇

  - Worry
  - Excitement
  - Gossip
  - Chattering
  - Nervousness
  - Anxiety

A lot of activity and energy is indicated when seeing Birds in your lenormand reading. There’s a strong sense of restlessness, of flitting about from one place to another, of manifold excitement that happens when these little animals gather together. Birds can be hyper alert,
filled with nervous anxiety that makes it difficult for them to stay in one place for too long.

This card can also be indicative of chatter happening in your life - and sometimes even gossip. When many birds gather, there seems to be an excited exchange of songs - building up to a constant stream of noise.

Another meaning of this card can include being distracted by many things
- your consciousness is focused on too many ideas, making it difficult for you to focus.

  - Where do I need to focus?
  - How can communicate with more substance?

# (13) The Child 🂫

  - New Beginnings
  - Child
  - Toddler
  - Play
  - Inexperience
  - Innocence
  - Immaturity

Though the Child Lenormand card can reference an actual child, it is sometimes more helpful to see it in a reading as an indication of a fresh start, or something that is new in one’s life. It can take the form of a new relationship, a new job, or a new way of thinking. To understand exactly what the card is referencing, you’ll have to look at the surrounding cards to find out.

Alongside this meaning, the Child Lenormand card also comes with the traits of innocence and naivete, as well as inexperience. Because you are going through a new process, you may tend to be more trusting and open, meaning you may be more vulnerable. You may make mistakes more often than others who have gone through this before. You may also be more playful and curious than others, meaning your innocence may bring a fresh approach and open up new perspectives where others may have overlooked.

  - Where in life can I benefit from starting over?
  - Am I being too naive?
  - Where can I find help from someone more experienced?
  - What can benefit from my fresh perspective?

# (14) The Fox 🃙

  - Selfishness
  - Self Care
  - Trickery
  - Suspicion
  - Cunning
  - Caution

A cunning trickster, the fox has been traditionally known to farmers as a thief that steals their hard earned crop. For that reason, some of the more common meanings to the fox include deception by a cunning and shrewd creature.

But we can also understand the fox as a creature that engages in that kind of behavior in order to adapt and survive. Sometimes, in order to make ends meet, we have to engage in egotistical and selfish behavior.
Self-care is sometimes interpreted by others as selfishness. The methods they use may certainly not be honest or fair, but those may be the only means available to them.

The intelligence of the Fox can also translate to not just sneaky behavior, but also suspicion and distrust. They tread lightly on their environments, aware of all the danger that may be lurking. This too, is a survival instinct.

  - How can I be more trusting?
  - What do I need to be cautious about?
  - Who may be being dishonest to me?
  - What do I have to do in order to make it through a troubling
    situation?

|Paired Card|Combined Meaning|

# (15) The Bear 🃚

  - Power
  - Leadership
  - Dominance
  - Influence
  - Short temper
  - Strength of character
  - Boss

Power and strength are represented by the Bear in Lenormand; and this power can manifest in many forms. It can be physical size, their position in society or work (such as a manager), their role in the family (like a parent), or even their personality (a dominating, bossy person).

The power that Bear Lenormand card wields can either be used for positive reasons, such as when a mother bear is protective of her cubs,
or for selfish reasons. In the best of light, the bear can represent a leader, one that both nurtures and teaches, guiding those in their care towards a better future. In this case, the Bear can represent someone that truly cares and is invested in your future.

Other times, the Bear card can represent people, that despite the best intentions, may be trying to assert themselves over our own decisions.
This can be through aggression, bullying, or even more subtle influence,
like that of a parent on a child who has internalized their wishes.

  - Where in life can I break free from other influences?
  - Where in life can I assert more leadership?
  - How can I use my own strength to my advantage?
  - Who can I look to for guidance?

# (16) The Star 🂶

  - Hope
  - Inspiration
  - Optimism
  - Spirituality
  - Dreams
  - Progress to Goals

Traditionally a symbol of wish fulfillment, the Star indicates progress towards one’s goals. As a strongly positive card, it stands for hope,
positivity, and dreams coming true. Like the north star, whose guidance leads weary travelers towards their destination, our aspirations and dreams help us stay the course towards our highest ideals. This card represents both the journey towards those visions, and the dream itself.

Sometimes, it can also mean hope and trust - in moments of doubt, the star beckons us to have faith that all will turn out well in the end,
that the path is sometimes long and winding, it cannot always be straightforward and smooth. When we look up at the stars and contemplate the vastness of space, we are humbled - for we remember that although we are only a tiny fraction of the universe, it is all interconnected. Our understanding of it is limited by human comprehension, meaning that sometimes, trust is all we can have.

# (17) The Stork 🂽

  - Change
  - Transition
  - Movement
  - Recurrence
  - New Cycle
  - Yearning

When seeing the Stork in your Lenormand readings, the card can indicate changes, transitions and transformations. The Stork is known as a bird with long migratory patterns, sometimes traveling between seasons between the southernmost tip of Africa to Europe.

Sometimes, this migration can be literal - you may be going through a geographical relocation. But more often, it can be a figurative movement
- where you are going through a process where you are redefining certain aspects of yourself. Usually, this is something that starts from within;
like the a change in the way you define love, or your own identity. This tends to shape the actions you take and how you make choices. The inward change radiates outward, and it is most times, a very slow process. To understand where in life you’re changing, you’ll have to take a look at the surrounding cards.

Finally, since migratory patterns are seasonal, the Stork card can also indicate cycles and returns. That means you can find yourself in recurring situations or feelings.

  - What is no longer serving me and needs to change?
  - What situation do I find myself in again and again?
  - How can I escape the cycle?
  - How can I reach my highest potential?

# (18) The Dog 🂺

  - Loyalty
  - Friendship
  - A Follower
  - Devotion
  - Obedience
  - Support

As humanity’s closest companion, the Dog card in a Lenormand reading can usually indicate a deep friendship based on loyalty and support. This card can come in the form of an actual person with these traits, or being surrounded by a support system, or acts of kindness in general.
Loving support can also sometimes turn into devotion, where someone focuses their entire attention towards another’s well-being and happiness. The person in question can be quite eager to please,
depending on another person’s views of them for their own self esteem.

In other cases, getting the Dog in a Lenormand reading can also indicate someone who his obedient, or a follower of some kind. While this can be positive, sometimes this card can also indicate someone that is unable to make decisions for themselves, and relies on others to make choices for them.

  - Who in my life has been showing me kindness?
  - How can I be more supportive?
  - What areas in life can I learn to be less of a follower?
  - Are my own desires being repressed for someone else?

# (19) The Tower 🂦

  - Authority
  - Solitude
  - Loneliness
  - Isolation
  - Aloofness
  - Ego
  - Arrogance

When we look at a tower from down on the ground, we feel small,
diminutive. From up above on the tower, looking down, we’ve created a distance and boundaries. These two perspectives form the basis for all the meanings in the Tower Lenormand card.

As someone looking up at the tower, we interpret these larger than life spaces to be in positions of authority - which is why this card sometimes stands for government institutions and bureaucratic organizations. There is a sense of impenetrability to these institutions, a feeling that they are quite removed from the average person, and it’s inner workings are hidden and mysterious.

As someone from inside the tower, we understand that we must sometimes protect ourselves - and towers were used as fortresses to defend against incoming attacks. Sometimes solitude is a form of self preservation, at times we must take a break from the hectic pace of life in order to recover and heal. If we extend this for too long however, this self-preservation instinct may turn into deep loneliness, and sometimes arrogance towards others.

# (20) The Garden 🂨

  - Public Affairs
  - Society
  - Culture
  - Teamwork
  - Fame
  - Social Networks

The Garden in Lenormand is more accurately represented by perhaps a Park; where many people from all over the community can congregate. The Garden represents all things that are in the public eye, and are relevant to a community of people.

To see the Garden card in a Lenormand reading will be indicative of public spaces, both physical spaces and online ones. It can represent what is on television, radio, the internet, society and culture in general.

Depending on the surrounding cards it can mean the release of something to the public, whether it is something tangible like a book, a product,
or a business - or something like a marriage announcement, or an announcement of one’s values or commitments.

  - What is the cultural climate?
  - What are things that society is concerned with right now?
  - What am I ready to reveal?
  - What will public opinion be of my actions?

# (21) The Mountain 🃘

  - Difficulties
  - Problems
  - Obstacles
  - Impairment
  - Hurdles
  - Struggles
  - Challenge

When the Mountain appears in your Lenormand card readings, you’ll have to beware of delays and obstacles coming your way. These problems will have to be overcome in order for your to continue progressing down your path. Whatever the form this obstacle will take, you must learn to move around it, or take it head on.

Remember that this obstacle does not have to be taken negatively.
Challenges in life are what force us to learn and grow. Without them, we remain stagnant. Thus, while initially the Mountain may seem daunting,
there is also a sense of pride and victory that we can earn from climbing and surpassing it.

The struggles that we face, and then overcome, can also become symbols of the persistence of human nature. This can be an additional dimension of the mountain card, should you choose to take the challenge that it references. It is by taking just one step at a time that we can overcome the biggest of challenges.

  - Who or what is standing in my way?
  - Is there an alternative path forward?
  - How can I break down this problem into smaller steps?
  - Is there anything I can learn from this challenge?

# (22) The Crossroad 🃍

  - Choices
  - Many Opportunities
  - Travel
  - Separation
  - Hesitation
  - Decisions

With many choices, comes many doubts. While you are being presented with opportunities, it seems that you must choose one path - which closes off the others. Because you know this, you are filled with hesitation. This will not be an easy task, and so your shoulders may feel heavy with the burden of this choice. Remember that you cannot avoid this burden, it is one that you must take in order to progress forward.

On a greater scale, this is the card of free will - indicating that the choices are yours to make - no matter how seemingly difficult the situation may seem.

  - What choice will bring you the most joy?
  - Why are you hesitating in your decision?
  - What are all of your options?
  - Where are you traveling to?

# (23) Mice 🃗

  - Dwindling
  - Deficiency
  - Depletion
  - Destruction
  - Defect
  - Flaw
  - Disease

Slow decay and deterioration are indicated by the Mice card. Though mice may initially seem harmless, many of them can become a problem when they start gnawing and nibbling away at food, resources and housing. It’s a slow process, but if not controlled, this card can cause devastating destruction. In Lenormand readings, this card can mean that something is slowly losing its force or strength - like a relationship that may be crumbling, or hope that is slowly fading. You may not even be conscious of it yet, but it is in the works - you’ll have to be more alert to see what may later become an issue.

Finally, because mice are sometimes carriers of disease - this card can also indicate some kind of metaphorical or internal corruption. You may be dealing with something that is tainted or polluted; there may be someone that does not have pure motivations for their actions, like a corrupt government (in the case of the tower card) for example.

  - Is there anything that I have to watch out for?
  - What has been slowly gnawing away at me?
  - What can I do to fix the problem before it becomes worse?
  - Is this situation worth saving?

# (24) The Heart 🂻

  - Love
  - Amicability
  - Romanticisation
  - Forgiveness
  - Reconciliation
  - Softness
  - Charity

The Heart Lenormand meaning is that of love - not necessarily romantic love, but a love that can extend to any being, and can be expressed in any way. Perhaps, another word we can use to explain this card is compassion. In some readings, especially those that are on the topic of a relationship, the heart is one of the most positive cards you can get about a romantic situation. There is a genuine and heartfelt connection here.

Sometimes though, our infatuations get the best of us, and our love of someone or something may make it difficult for us to see their flaws. We can start believing what we want to believe about them. So while this card generally can be positive, we must also ask ourselves whether we are not seeing the whole picture here.

When the heart shows up in readings outside of the scope of romance, it usually indicates that there is empathy, compassion and care in this reading, whether it is with friends, family or the community. Decisions here are being made with consideration to all, and with the best interests in mind.

  - How can I be more loving?
  - Where in life can I be more compassionate?
  - Where I being too idealistic?
  - Who can I be more compassionate to?
  - How can I show my love?

# (25) The Ring 🃑

  - Commitment
  - Promise
  - Honor
  - Partnership
  - Cooperation
  - Cycles

Commitment and agreements, whether in love, business or anything in between, are represented by the ring in Lenormand readings. Something links two things together, a connection - which can be both practical or emotional, mutual or one-sided. Though it can represent the link between two people or organizations, it can also represent a commitment to a principle, an idea, or a value - a pledge that one makes towards oneself. The commonality between all these readings of the ring card is that one is bound by honor, morality, and sometimes even legal arrangements.

To see this card means that you must consider the weight of all the commitments that you make - that your promises reflect on your character and your standing.

Sometimes, the ring appearing in a Lenormand reading can also signal a process or event that is repetitive and cyclic, and you may be feeling as though you are going around in circles.

  - What commitments am I making to both others and myself?
  - Can I keep the promises that I make to others?
  - What problems do I keep getting caught up in?
  - How can I better cooperate with others?

# (26) The Book 🃊

  - Secrets
  - Knowledge
  - Education
  - Information
  - Research
  - Studies

One of the more simpler cards in the deck, the Book is representative of knowledge, education and learning. It is also associated sometimes with secrets and truth - things that can be discovered with the aid of knowledge. As the card of all those that seek truth, it usually represents the process that we go through to gain knowledge, such as becoming a student, or going through a period of intense study.

Another simple reading of the book Lenormand card is that of intelligence, specifically in the context of academic intelligence - the knowledge that one gets through a formal education. In some situations though, knowledge and intellectuality can also create snobbery.

Some interpretations also include secret knowledge, or esoteric knowledge - what is written within a book’s pages are sometimes not yet discovered by the reader, and it is only through research and study that one can access truth.

  - What is it that I need to learn?
  - What am I keeping secret?
  - What knowledge am I missing?
  - Where can I find truth?

  - Document
  - Email
  - Speech
  - Conversations
  - Expression
  - Information
  - Communication

Communication is the foundation of the Letter Lenormand card - in all its forms. While in the traditional sense, communication took place most commonly in the form of an actual letter, we do not have to limit our interpretations to that medium alone. This card can stand for expression in both email, text, speech, or conversations - information and knowledge which is being shared with others. The card leaves it somewhat open to whom this information is being shared with. In order to understand its contents and its recipient, the other cards surrounding it will have to be examined.

Another, more specialized meaning of the Letter Lenormand card can mean documentation or paperwork of any kind. It can mean things such as diplomas, certificates, resumes, invoices and permits, for example.

  - What do I need to communicate?
  - Who do I need to reach out to?
  - What kind of documentation do I need?
  - What am I holding inside?

# (28) The Man (Animus) 🂱

  - Male in Querent’s Life (Male Friend, Partner, Family Member)
  - If the Querent is Male, The Querent
  - Masculinity

While the original lenormand card is called “man”, I wanted to expand the definition of this card to focus on masculinity - all the behaviors and energy typically associated with men, but not necessarily someone who is physically male.

This energy can be more logical than emotional, more aggressive than receptive, more physical than spiritual, and dependent on your own personal cultural experiences.

This card can sometimes reference the querent, especially if they have a lot of masculine traits. But it can also refer to someone in the querent’s life with those qualities. This person will usually be close to the querent’s life - for example, a significant other, a family member or a close friend. This person plays a large part in the querent’s life.

In order to understand this card, you’ll have to look at the surrounding cards, which will give you more details on the characteristics of this person this refers to.

  - What masculine influences are in my life?
  - Is there a masculine figure that can help me?
  - How can I think about this situation in a logical manner?

While the original lenormand card is called “man”, I wanted to expand the definition of this card to focus on femininity in general - all the behaviors and energy typically associated with women, but not necessarily someone who is physically female.

This person’s energy can be more emotional than logical, more receptive than aggressive, more spiritual than physical, as well as dependent on your own personal cultural experiences.

This card can sometimes reference the querent, especially if they have a lot of feminine traits. But it can also refer to someone in the querent’s life with those qualities.

# (30) The Lily 🂮

  - Sensuality
  - Sex
  - Virtue
  - Morality
  - Ethics
  - Wisdom

With the lily, we really find ourselves seeing two faces of the same card - faces that are profoundly paradoxical - which gives the lily card it’s beauty. You can almost say, that the lily card suffers from a bit of a madonna-whore complex. It can represent the greater struggle of femininity to walk the line between passionate sensuality and gentle innocence.

When you see the card in a reading, it can either signal all things associated with sex, pleasure, and material and bodily comfort or it can signal virtue, purity, and morality.

On one hand, it represents the side of life that experiences everything through our senses - touch, smell, taste particularly, and the enjoyment of all those things. It represents intense experiences that we have through our bodies, and feeling rooted and grounded within them.

On the other hand, the lily is rather ethereal - we find her representing all that is virtuous and good - mercy, justice, kindness,
as well as pure intentions and a pure heart.

  - What is the most pleasurable to me?
  - What is the right thing to do?
  - What is it to be good? What does virtue mean to me?

  - Happiness

An extremely positive card in Lenormand decks, the Sun is a card of victory, happiness and success. As the giver of life, having the Sun in your reading shines a light onto the situation, and the other cards within the spread. It lends a general sense of optimism to the reading,
that things are being done with happiness and and warmth. It illuminates a dark situation - even when there are more negative cards in the reading.

As the source of light, it not only brings happiness or hope to what can be negative, it also can illuminate that which is hidden, bringing truth from the unknown. Thus, the sun can also represent something becoming visible and coming into your awareness.

# (32) The Moon 🂸

  - Subconscious
  - Intuition
  - Emotions
  - Fears
  - Desires
  - Fantasy

It is at night, under the cover of darkness and the light of the moon when we are able to dream, and access our subconscious. The daylight no longer reigns supreme, logic and truth become more arbitrary concepts,
and our minds can imagine and follow the winding paths of our intuition.
What is not addressed in the light of day, comes out at night - all our hidden and repressed emotions, fears, and desires. As such, the moon tends to represent our emotional life - perhaps parts of ourselves that we cannot address in the waking day - the darker shadow aspects of our own selves that we must confront and integrate in order to develop as human beings.

It is through our intuition that we may gain certain insights that we might not have found through logical understanding - so the moon can represent too, all things that exist but we are not yet knowledgeable about. Things may have been brewing underneath the surface, but perhaps your consciousness has not processed it yet.

  - What does your intuition tell you?
  - What is it that you desire but are ashamed of wanting?
  - What is that you fear?
  - What are you repressing?

# (33) The Key 🃈

  - Openness
  - Revelation
  - Unlocking
  - Achievement
  - Liberation
  - Resolution

When we see the Key in our Lenormand readings, we are coming across something that will open up new pathways for us. That means that what was perhaps an obstacle for you in the past is now dissolving. This new pathway can be interpreted in several ways - sometimes it can be the removal of a physical obstacle, or it can come in the form of a new way of thinking that lets you open your eyes and your heart to new possibilities and perspectives - a revelation of some sort that gives you a new solution.

Other times, the Key can also mean freedom from past restrictions;
imagine being locked up in a cell where, but finally having the key to get out. Whether real or psychological, the key can represent freedom from some kind of confinement.

Finally, the Key can mean achievement, for it gives us access to what we need in order to make it through to the other side, and achieve our goals.

  - What am I being freed from?
  - What am I missing to achieve my goals?
  - How can I open up closed doors?
  - What would I like to achieve?

# (34) The Fish 🃎

  - Finances
  - Business
  - Wealth
  - Values
  - Gain
  - Abundance

Wealth is what is referenced when seeing the Fish in a Lenormand reading. This can be in the standard traditional sense of material goods
- concerning finances and business, or it can be in a simpler sense of having many of something, or understanding the value of something. Thus,
when looking at the cards, it can simply mean the cards are speaking about something in the financial realm, or the card can really help us examine what it is that is valuable to us. Some things are worthless on paper, but emotionally valuable - a principle, a feeling, an object or something you do.

The Fish card also asks us to think about what abundance really means -
whether it is the quantity of something or another trait. A negative trait about this card is that it tends to focus on numbers rather than other qualities that we might find more compelling.

  - What areas of my life are filled with abundance?
  - What is it that I really value?
  - Where am I being too greedy?

# (35) The Anchor 🂩

  - Stability
  - Restraint
  - Security
  - Resilience
  - Durability
  - Laying Foundations

To see the Anchor in your Lenormand reading signals your tenacity at reaching a goal or completing a task. Despite whatever setbacks or tricky situations you find yourself in, you remain steadfast in your choices. Something is giving you the strength and the stability to keep you focused on your desires in the changing winds.

The solid focus that the anchor imparts can either be positive or negative - on one hand it creates an environment of safety, but it can also mean that you can become so inflexible that you cannot let go of ideas, concepts or goals that are not really serving you. Whether the anchor in your Lenormand reading becomes a positive or negative force is something that is up to you, and how you choose to use it in the context of your life.

  - What gives you a sense of stability?
  - How can I create a greater sense of security?
  - What foundations am I setting for myself?
  - What are things that I must let go of?

# (36) The Cross 🃖

  - Duty
  - Conviction
  - Suffering
  - Burden
  - Intolerance
  - Principles
  - Indoctrination

While the Cross can be representative of organized religion, this Lenormand card’s meaning can also be expanded to include the concepts of ideology and responsibility - such as when we come across the phrase
“one’s cross to bear”. Ideologies direct our goals, our actions and our values - they create a division between what is “good” and what is
“bad”. They tell us what we should do and what we should not do, and can become incredibly harmful when taken to extremes. It is through ideologies that we learn to judge others, and judge ourselves -
sometimes going too far and creating a culture of intolerance.

Because ideologies have value judgements, they become closely tied with this Lenormand card’s other meanings. Sometimes what is considered the
“right” thing to do can drive us towards great accomplishments and fulfillment, but it can also, especially in cases where those ideals and principles are far too extreme, become a heavy burden. We cannot be perfect creatures all the time, we are only human.

  - Where in life do I feel burdened?
  - What are my values and why?
  - What do I consider absolutes in my life?
  - Where am I being too judgemental?
