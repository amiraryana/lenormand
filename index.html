<p>Something is coming your way, and you better be prepared! When The
Rider appears in your lenormand reading, it usually means that the
delays that might have fettered you before are going to be released. A
rapid burst of activity is about to occur, leaving you filled with
passionate energy. You might find that your day is hectic and action
packed.</p>
<p>This card may come in the form of either a person, a message, or an
event. While the general feeling behind this card is positive, it also
usually means that what comes your way is not something that will stick
permanency is not the Rider’s strong suit. Consider this card a fleeting
opportunity that needs your swift action to benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are you heading in such great speed?</li>
<li>What must you prepare for?</li>
<li>What will I do once I have nothing holding me back?</li>
<li>Where is my passion coming from?</li>

<p>To find the Clover in a Lenormand reading (and in real life) is
usually a sign of a happy coincidence of some sort. It is associated
with luck and opportunities, though ones that are not too significant in
nature. We associate the Clover card with life’s small joys - which are
usually fleeting, passing by at a moment’s notice. Therefore, the Clover
is also indicative of something that we must take quick action to reap
the benefits of. You’ve only got a short window to make use of this
chance!</p>
<p>This card also lends a feeling of lightheartedness and humor to any
situation. When things in life are fleeting and ever-changing, whether
the situations are positive and negative, we can learn to not take them
too seriously. Remembering that all things pass can help us lighten up,
but perhaps may also make us take our responsibilities too lightly.
You’ll have to look to the remainder of all your cards in order to
interpret this with some accuracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>What opportunities can I act on?</li>
<li>Where in life can you stand to be a bit more lighthearted?</li>
<li>Where in life can I take things more seriously?</li>

</ul>
<p>At the heart of the Ship card is the concept of travel, of journeys
and all that one experiences during it. It can very well mean taking a
trip of some kind to a far off place, but it can also signify the mental
state of travel - the desire to see new places, to explore and to voyage
into the unknown. Regardless of whether you are actually, physically
making a journey, this card signals heading out on an adventure of some
sort - where you are going far from what is familiar.</p>
<p>This card can also imply distance to its surrounding cards, sometimes
concerning long-distance relationships, far away family, or an overseas
business trip - depending on your question and the other cards in the
spread. This definition too, can also be more metaphorical in nature.
While you may be in close proximity physically to something, you may not
feel close to it.</p>
<p>Finally this card can also signal the choice to move away from
something. While journeys can be taken in the search for new, unexplored
realms, there are times too when we must undertake a journey in order to
leave something else behind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in life is unexplored for me?</li>
<li>With what or with who do I feel distanced from?</li>
<li>How can I be more adventurous?</li>
<li>What am I looking for?</li>
<li>What am I trying to get away from?</li>

<p>When the House appears in one’s Lenormand card reading, issues of
family and home life are being referenced. It can signal both the
physical space, the people within it - such as specific family members,
and also the more abstract concept of home. When we think of places that
feel like home, they are places where we feel safe, where we feel
protected, where we feel like we belong, where we are comfortable.</p>
<p>This same sense of belonging and comfort, while creating stability
and security - can also make it difficult to go forth and try new ways
of doing things. The house is a boundary between what is outside and
what is inside - it is a bubble or a barrier, something which separates.
It implies that there is an “us” and a “them”. This can mean keeping
things away from the private eye, but also can translate to the feeling
of close-mindedness.</p>

<li>Do I feel at home?</li>

<li>Spirituality</li>
<li>Health</li>
</ul>
<p>This card can comment on a variety of things - though in more general
situations, it focuses on wellbeing and health - both in a physical and
a spiritual sense. The tree asks us to look at ourselves from a
wholistic perspective. Perhaps it is an indication to take a walk with
nature.</p>
<p>Our roots lie far back in our pasts, so timing wise, it tends to
refer to past events and situations - a current moment grounded in what
came before. Like a tree, what is happening today perhaps took quite a
bit of time to grow - but what came out of that time created
security.</p>
<p>With its many intertwining branches, it also reminds us that we are
all connected - and thus the card can also indicate there is a deep bond
between two people in a reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does your higher self say?</li>
<li>How does this help me develop as a human being?</li>
<li>From when did this start happening?</li>
<li>How do I find connections between myself and others?</li>

<p>As a metaphor, when clouds are blocking out the sun, we are unable to
see the light of truth. A cloud can act as a veil that obscures
something; an in a Lenormand reading, the Cloud stands for that which is
hidden, and the doubts and confusion caused by lack of clarity.</p>
<p>You might be finding yourself in a moment where you are unsure of
what choices you can take, or where you can go. Because you have so
little guidelines, you might be feeling lost.</p>
<p>The clouds themselves too, are vapor - never necessarily having a
tangible shape; it’s another sense in which clouds in a Lenormand
reading can indicate how vagueness creates more misunderstandings.</p>

<li>Forbidden Knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>As one of humanity’s most ancient symbols, seeing the Snake in your
Lenormand reading can reflect many aspects and faces of this animal.
Desire and craving, or ambition is one of these facets, especially a
desire of the sort that very strong, almost consuming. Some of these
desires can be harmless, and others, when uncontrolled, can lead to a
kind of addiction. There is also the sense that the kind of desire that
is represented by the snake is so strong, that incredible determination
comes alongside it - sometimes making for an almost single-minded
focus.</p>
<p>Another facet of the snake can involve deception - to be specific,
the kind of deception that is calculating and self serving, almost
manipulative.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of the Snake card in Lenormand that is rarely
used, but just as important, is its wisdom and knowledge. While in more
traditional interpretations, such as the ones above, it has been
plastered with morality, there is a more pure reading of the snake that
has none of those value judgements. In other cultures, their
intelligence is revered, and sacred, and even in western
interpretations, we must remember that it was the snake that brought us
truth - though, forbidden truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do I desire the things I do?</li>
<li>How far will I go to get that which I desire?</li>
<li>What do I desire that is forbidden to me?</li>
<li>Is my desire controlling me?</li>

<p>The Coffin Lenormand card speaks about loss and all its related
hardships - it is about the emotional process and transitions we have to
make when something which we hold dear ceases to exist. This Lenormand
card indicates that you are going through an ending, and you’ll have to
look towards the other cards within the reading to understand what this
ending is about; perhaps a state of mind, a relationship, a job, or a
deeply held belief.</p>
<p>Alongside loss, comes suffering, and the coffin card can also
indicate grief and mourning - a stage that we must go through in order
to let something that we’ve lost go. Sometimes, the card can indicate
that your progress is stalled because you cannot let go, and properly
mourn and release a deep seated pain.</p>
<p>Finally, this card can also indicate burying - we are putting
something so deep in the ground that we can never access it again. This
card can indicate that you are repressing something; it could be
feelings, wishes, desires, fears - things that perhaps you may feel deep
shame or guilt about.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I have to let go?</li>
<li>What haven’t I mourned yet?</li>
<li>What am I repressing?</li>
<li>How can I move beyond this loss?</li>

<p>Joyful and light social interactions are represented by the Bouquet
Lenormand card. This card indicates that we are being presented with
some of life’s more pleasant occasions, and we should be taking some
time to enjoy them. This card indicates that this is a good chance to
develop friendships, reach out, and take pleasure in the kind of
happiness that others can bring.</p>
<p>The Bouquet can also be an expression of gratitude and appreciation -
it is a token of thanks and recognition that we give to those who
support us. This token can be both from sincere feelings, or out of
social politeness, or sometimes flattery with a hidden ulterior motive.
It is up to the reader and the surrounding cards to determine which face
of the Bouquet is present.</p>

me?</li>

<p>You’ll have to be on the lookout for something when you see the
Scythe card appear in a Lenormand reading. A sudden ending is on the
horizon, and it will most likely come without warning or expectation -
though we must remember that all endings are not necessarily harmful
ones. The ending will most likely be swift, and signal a clear break -
and what occurs can also lead to lasting effects.</p>
<p>On a more symbolic level, the Scythe represents harvesting - a time
when we are reaping the rewards (or punishments) of our past actions. It
can mean a moment of taking stock of what we have accomplished, of
self-judgement and reckoning. We must look backward to understand what
we can best do to move forward and learn from what has been completed.
Therefore, the Scythe can also signal a closure in that sense.</p>

<p>The Whip Lenormand card is an indicator of conflict, of arguments and
aggression. As a symbol, it has a long history of being used as a form
of punishment and abuse. Usually, this card will indicate some kind of
verbal disagreement - when two different modes of thinking collide.
During more heated episodes, arguments can turn personal, meaning that
this card can also stand for insults and personal attacks. In rare
instances, the Whip Lenormand card can also stand for abuse of a
physical kind too.</p>
<p>The Whip Lenormand card can also stand for any kind of destructive
behavior that is fueled by negativity - sometimes the card exists to
show that the motivations behind actions are to simply cause another
person pain. This card can be a stand in for the suffering that we
receive from others.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, when one undergoes the suffering for so
long, we can internalize the messages of the Whip card - it can become a
form of self-punishment. We can carry with us deep feelings of shame and
guilt, that leads us to a cycle of self-hatred.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in my life is there too much conflict?</li>
<li>Is there anyone who is purposely trying to cause me pain?</li>
<li>Where in my life am I holding onto deep shame?</li>
<li>How can I stand up for myself more?</li>

<p>A lot of activity and energy is indicated when seeing Birds in your
lenormand reading. There’s a strong sense of restlessness, of flitting
about from one place to another, of manifold excitement that happens
when these little animals gather together. Birds can be hyper alert,
filled with nervous anxiety that makes it difficult for them to stay in
one place for too long.</p>
<p>This card can also be indicative of chatter happening in your life -
and sometimes even gossip. When many birds gather, there seems to be an
excited exchange of songs - building up to a constant stream of
noise.</p>
<p>Another meaning of this card can include being distracted by many
things - your consciousness is focused on too many ideas, making it
difficult for you to focus.</p>

<p>Though the Child Lenormand card can reference an actual child, it is
sometimes more helpful to see it in a reading as an indication of a
fresh start, or something that is new in one’s life. It can take the
form of a new relationship, a new job, or a new way of thinking. To
understand exactly what the card is referencing, you’ll have to look at
the surrounding cards to find out.</p>
<p>Alongside this meaning, the Child Lenormand card also comes with the
traits of innocence and naivete, as well as inexperience. Because you
are going through a new process, you may tend to be more trusting and
open, meaning you may be more vulnerable. You may make mistakes more
often than others who have gone through this before. You may also be
more playful and curious than others, meaning your innocence may bring a
fresh approach and open up new perspectives where others may have
overlooked.</p>

<li>Where in life can I benefit from starting over?</li>
<li>Am I being too naive?</li>
<li>Where can I find help from someone more experienced?</li>

<p>A cunning trickster, the fox has been traditionally known to farmers
as a thief that steals their hard earned crop. For that reason, some of
the more common meanings to the fox include deception by a cunning and
shrewd creature.</p>
<p>But we can also understand the fox as a creature that engages in that
kind of behavior in order to adapt and survive. Sometimes, in order to
make ends meet, we have to engage in egotistical and selfish behavior.
Self-care is sometimes interpreted by others as selfishness. The methods
they use may certainly not be honest or fair, but those may be the only
means available to them.</p>
<p>The intelligence of the Fox can also translate to not just sneaky
behavior, but also suspicion and distrust. They tread lightly on their
environments, aware of all the danger that may be lurking. This too, is
a survival instinct.</p>

<p>Power and strength are represented by the Bear in Lenormand; and this
power can manifest in many forms. It can be physical size, their
position in society or work (such as a manager), their role in the
family (like a parent), or even their personality (a dominating, bossy
person).</p>
<p>The power that Bear Lenormand card wields can either be used for
positive reasons, such as when a mother bear is protective of her cubs,
or for selfish reasons. In the best of light, the bear can represent a
leader, one that both nurtures and teaches, guiding those in their care
towards a better future. In this case, the Bear can represent someone
that truly cares and is invested in your future.</p>
<p>Other times, the Bear card can represent people, that despite the
best intentions, may be trying to assert themselves over our own
decisions. This can be through aggression, bullying, or even more subtle
influence, like that of a parent on a child who has internalized their
wishes.</p>

<p>When seeing the Stork in your Lenormand readings, the card can
indicate changes, transitions and transformations. The Stork is known as
a bird with long migratory patterns, sometimes traveling between seasons
between the southernmost tip of Africa to Europe.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this migration can be literal - you may be going through a
geographical relocation. But more often, it can be a figurative movement
- where you are going through a process where you are redefining certain
aspects of yourself. Usually, this is something that starts from within;
like the a change in the way you define love, or your own identity. This
tends to shape the actions you take and how you make choices. The inward
change radiates outward, and it is most times, a very slow process. To
understand where in life you’re changing, you’ll have to take a look at
the surrounding cards.</p>
<p>Finally, since migratory patterns are seasonal, the Stork card can
also indicate cycles and returns. That means you can find yourself in
recurring situations or feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is no longer serving me and needs to change?</li>
<li>What situation do I find myself in again and again?</li>
<li>How can I escape the cycle?</li>
<li>How can I reach my highest potential?</li>

<p>As humanity’s closest companion, the Dog card in a Lenormand reading
can usually indicate a deep friendship based on loyalty and support.
This card can come in the form of an actual person with these traits, or
being surrounded by a support system, or acts of kindness in general.
Loving support can also sometimes turn into devotion, where someone
focuses their entire attention towards another’s well-being and
happiness. The person in question can be quite eager to please,
depending on another person’s views of them for their own self
esteem.</p>
<p>In other cases, getting the Dog in a Lenormand reading can also
indicate someone who his obedient, or a follower of some kind. While
this can be positive, sometimes this card can also indicate someone that
is unable to make decisions for themselves, and relies on others to make
choices for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who in my life has been showing me kindness?</li>
<li>How can I be more supportive?</li>
<li>What areas in life can I learn to be less of a follower?</li>

<p>When we look at a tower from down on the ground, we feel small,
diminutive. From up above on the tower, looking down, we’ve created a
distance and boundaries. These two perspectives form the basis for all
the meanings in the Tower Lenormand card.</p>
<p>As someone looking up at the tower, we interpret these larger than
life spaces to be in positions of authority - which is why this card
sometimes stands for government institutions and bureaucratic
organizations. There is a sense of impenetrability to these
institutions, a feeling that they are quite removed from the average
person, and it’s inner workings are hidden and mysterious.</p>
<p>As someone from inside the tower, we understand that we must
sometimes protect ourselves - and towers were used as fortresses to
defend against incoming attacks. Sometimes solitude is a form of self
preservation, at times we must take a break from the hectic pace of life
in order to recover and heal. If we extend this for too long however,
this self-preservation instinct may turn into deep loneliness, and
sometimes arrogance towards others.</p>

<p>The Garden in Lenormand is more accurately represented by perhaps a
Park; where many people from all over the community can congregate. The
Garden represents all things that are in the public eye, and are
relevant to a community of people.</p>
<p>To see the Garden card in a Lenormand reading will be indicative of
public spaces, both physical spaces and online ones. It can represent
what is on television, radio, the internet, society and culture in
general.</p>
<p>Depending on the surrounding cards it can mean the release of
something to the public, whether it is something tangible like a book, a
product, or a business - or something like a marriage announcement, or
an announcement of one’s values or commitments.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the cultural climate?</li>
<li>What are things that society is concerned with right now?</li>
<li>What am I ready to reveal?</li>

<p>When the Mountain appears in your Lenormand card readings, you’ll
have to beware of delays and obstacles coming your way. These problems
will have to be overcome in order for your to continue progressing down
your path. Whatever the form this obstacle will take, you must learn to
move around it, or take it head on.</p>
<p>Remember that this obstacle does not have to be taken negatively.
Challenges in life are what force us to learn and grow. Without them, we
remain stagnant. Thus, while initially the Mountain may seem daunting,
there is also a sense of pride and victory that we can earn from
climbing and surpassing it.</p>
<p>The struggles that we face, and then overcome, can also become
symbols of the persistence of human nature. This can be an additional
dimension of the mountain card, should you choose to take the challenge
that it references. It is by taking just one step at a time that we can
overcome the biggest of challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who or what is standing in my way?</li>
<li>Is there an alternative path forward?</li>
<li>How can I break down this problem into smaller steps?</li>
<li>Is there anything I can learn from this challenge?</li>

<p>With many choices, comes many doubts. While you are being presented
with opportunities, it seems that you must choose one path - which
closes off the others. Because you know this, you are filled with
hesitation. This will not be an easy task, and so your shoulders may
feel heavy with the burden of this choice. Remember that you cannot
avoid this burden, it is one that you must take in order to progress
forward.</p>
<p>On a greater scale, this is the card of free will - indicating that

<p>Slow decay and deterioration are indicated by the Mice card. Though
mice may initially seem harmless, many of them can become a problem when
they start gnawing and nibbling away at food, resources and housing.
It’s a slow process, but if not controlled, this card can cause
devastating destruction. In Lenormand readings, this card can mean that
something is slowly losing its force or strength - like a relationship
that may be crumbling, or hope that is slowly fading. You may not even
be conscious of it yet, but it is in the works - you’ll have to be more
alert to see what may later become an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, because mice are sometimes carriers of disease - this card
can also indicate some kind of metaphorical or internal corruption. You
may be dealing with something that is tainted or polluted; there may be
someone that does not have pure motivations for their actions, like a
corrupt government (in the case of the tower card) for example.</p>

<p>The Heart Lenormand meaning is that of love - not necessarily
romantic love, but a love that can extend to any being, and can be
expressed in any way. Perhaps, another word we can use to explain this
card is compassion. In some readings, especially those that are on the
topic of a relationship, the heart is one of the most positive cards you
can get about a romantic situation. There is a genuine and heartfelt
connection here.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, our infatuations get the best of us, and our love
of someone or something may make it difficult for us to see their flaws.
We can start believing what we want to believe about them. So while this
card generally can be positive, we must also ask ourselves whether we
are not seeing the whole picture here.</p>
<p>When the heart shows up in readings outside of the scope of romance,
it usually indicates that there is empathy, compassion and care in this
reading, whether it is with friends, family or the community. Decisions
here are being made with consideration to all, and with the best
interests in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I be more loving?</li>
<li>Where in life can I be more compassionate?</li>
<li>Where I being too idealistic?</li>
<li>Who can I be more compassionate to?</li>
<li>How can I show my love?</li>

</ul>
<p>Commitment and agreements, whether in love, business or anything in
between, are represented by the ring in Lenormand readings. Something
links two things together, a connection - which can be both practical or
emotional, mutual or one-sided. Though it can represent the link between
two people or organizations, it can also represent a commitment to a
principle, an idea, or a value - a pledge that one makes towards
oneself. The commonality between all these readings of the ring card is
that one is bound by honor, morality, and sometimes even legal
arrangements.</p>
<p>To see this card means that you must consider the weight of all the
commitments that you make - that your promises reflect on your character
and your standing.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the ring appearing in a Lenormand reading can also signal
a process or event that is repetitive and cyclic, and you may be feeling
as though you are going around in circles.</p>
<ul>
<li>What commitments am I making to both others and myself?</li>
<li>Can I keep the promises that I make to others?</li>
<li>What problems do I keep getting caught up in?</li>
<li>How can I better cooperate with others?</li>

<p>One of the more simpler cards in the deck, the Book is representative
of knowledge, education and learning. It is also associated sometimes
with secrets and truth - things that can be discovered with the aid of
knowledge. As the card of all those that seek truth, it usually
represents the process that we go through to gain knowledge, such as
becoming a student, or going through a period of intense study.</p>
<p>Another simple reading of the book Lenormand card is that of
intelligence, specifically in the context of academic intelligence - the
knowledge that one gets through a formal education. In some situations
though, knowledge and intellectuality can also create snobbery.</p>
<p>Some interpretations also include secret knowledge, or esoteric
knowledge - what is written within a book’s pages are sometimes not yet
discovered by the reader, and it is only through research and study that
one can access truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it that I need to learn?</li>

<p>Communication is the foundation of the Letter Lenormand card - in all
its forms. While in the traditional sense, communication took place most
commonly in the form of an actual letter, we do not have to limit our
interpretations to that medium alone. This card can stand for expression
in both email, text, speech, or conversations - information and
knowledge which is being shared with others. The card leaves it somewhat
open to whom this information is being shared with. In order to
understand its contents and its recipient, the other cards surrounding
it will have to be examined.</p>
<p>Another, more specialized meaning of the Letter Lenormand card can
mean documentation or paperwork of any kind. It can mean things such as
diplomas, certificates, resumes, invoices and permits, for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I need to communicate?</li>
<li>Who do I need to reach out to?</li>
<li>What kind of documentation do I need?</li>
<li>What am I holding inside?</li>

<li>If the Querent is Male, The Querent</li>
<li>Masculinity</li>
</ul>
<p>While the original lenormand card is called “man”, I wanted to expand
the definition of this card to focus on masculinity - all the behaviors
and energy typically associated with men, but not necessarily someone
who is physically male.</p>
<p>This energy can be more logical than emotional, more aggressive than
receptive, more physical than spiritual, and dependent on your own
personal cultural experiences.</p>
<p>This card can sometimes reference the querent, especially if they
have a lot of masculine traits. But it can also refer to someone in the
querent’s life with those qualities. This person will usually be close
to the querent’s life - for example, a significant other, a family
member or a close friend. This person plays a large part in the
querent’s life.</p>
<p>In order to understand this card, you’ll have to look at the
surrounding cards, which will give you more details on the
characteristics of this person this refers to.</p>
<ul>
<li>What masculine influences are in my life?</li>
<li>Is there a masculine figure that can help me?</li>
<li>How can I think about this situation in a logical manner?</li>

<li>If the Querent is Female, The Querent</li>
<li>Femininity</li>
</ul>
<p>While the original lenormand card is called “man”, I wanted to expand
the definition of this card to focus on femininity in general - all the
behaviors and energy typically associated with women, but not
necessarily someone who is physically female.</p>
<p>This person’s energy can be more emotional than logical, more
receptive than aggressive, more spiritual than physical, as well as
dependent on your own personal cultural experiences.</p>
<p>This card can sometimes reference the querent, especially if they
have a lot of feminine traits. But it can also refer to someone in the
querent’s life with those qualities. This person will usually be close
to the querent’s life - for example, a significant other, a family
member or a close friend. This person plays a large part in the
querent’s life.</p>
<p>In order to understand this card, you’ll have to look at the
surrounding cards, which will give you more details on the
characteristics of this person this refers to.</p>
<ul>
<li>What feminine influences are in my life?</li>
<li>Is there a feminine figure that can help me?</li>
<li>How can I think about this situation in a intuitive manner?</li>

<p>With the lily, we really find ourselves seeing two faces of the same
card - faces that are profoundly paradoxical - which gives the lily card
it’s beauty. You can almost say, that the lily card suffers from a bit
of a madonna-whore complex. It can represent the greater struggle of
femininity to walk the line between passionate sensuality and gentle
innocence.</p>
<p>When you see the card in a reading, it can either signal all things
associated with sex, pleasure, and material and bodily comfort or it can
signal virtue, purity, and morality.</p>
<p>On one hand, it represents the side of life that experiences
everything through our senses - touch, smell, taste particularly, and
the enjoyment of all those things. It represents intense experiences
that we have through our bodies, and feeling rooted and grounded within
them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the lily is rather ethereal - we find her
representing all that is virtuous and good - mercy, justice, kindness,
as well as pure intentions and a pure heart.</p>

<p>An extremely positive card in Lenormand decks, the Sun is a card of
victory, happiness and success. As the giver of life, having the Sun in
your reading shines a light onto the situation, and the other cards
within the spread. It lends a general sense of optimism to the reading,
that things are being done with happiness and and warmth. It illuminates
a dark situation - even when there are more negative cards in the
reading.</p>
<p>As the source of light, it not only brings happiness or hope to what
can be negative, it also can illuminate that which is hidden, bringing
truth from the unknown. Thus, the sun can also represent something
becoming visible and coming into your awareness.</p>

<li>What will make me happy?</li>
<li>Do I believe in my own success?</li>

<p>It is at night, under the cover of darkness and the light of the moon
when we are able to dream, and access our subconscious. The daylight no
longer reigns supreme, logic and truth become more arbitrary concepts,
and our minds can imagine and follow the winding paths of our intuition.
What is not addressed in the light of day, comes out at night - all our
hidden and repressed emotions, fears, and desires. As such, the moon
tends to represent our emotional life - perhaps parts of ourselves that
we cannot address in the waking day - the darker shadow aspects of our
own selves that we must confront and integrate in order to develop as
human beings.</p>
<p>It is through our intuition that we may gain certain insights that we
might not have found through logical understanding - so the moon can
represent too, all things that exist but we are not yet knowledgeable
about. Things may have been brewing underneath the surface, but perhaps
your consciousness has not processed it yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does your intuition tell you?</li>
<li>What is it that you desire but are ashamed of wanting?</li>

<p>When we see the Key in our Lenormand readings, we are coming across
something that will open up new pathways for us. That means that what
was perhaps an obstacle for you in the past is now dissolving. This new
pathway can be interpreted in several ways - sometimes it can be the
removal of a physical obstacle, or it can come in the form of a new way
of thinking that lets you open your eyes and your heart to new
possibilities and perspectives - a revelation of some sort that gives
you a new solution.</p>
<p>Other times, the Key can also mean freedom from past restrictions;
imagine being locked up in a cell where, but finally having the key to
get out. Whether real or psychological, the key can represent freedom
from some kind of confinement.</p>
<p>Finally, the Key can mean achievement, for it gives us access to what
we need in order to make it through to the other side, and achieve our
goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I being freed from?</li>
<li>What am I missing to achieve my goals?</li>
<li>How can I open up closed doors?</li>
<li>What would I like to achieve?</li>

<p>Wealth is what is referenced when seeing the Fish in a Lenormand
reading. This can be in the standard traditional sense of material goods
- concerning finances and business, or it can be in a simpler sense of
having many of something, or understanding the value of something. Thus,
when looking at the cards, it can simply mean the cards are speaking
about something in the financial realm, or the card can really help us
examine what it is that is valuable to us. Some things are worthless on
paper, but emotionally valuable - a principle, a feeling, an object or
something you do.</p>
<p>The Fish card also asks us to think about what abundance really means
- whether it is the quantity of something or another trait. A negative
trait about this card is that it tends to focus on numbers rather than
other qualities that we might find more compelling.</p>
<ul>
<li>What areas of my life are filled with abundance?</li>
<li>What is it that I really value?</li>
<li>Where am I being too greedy?</li>
<li>Where have I lost touch with the true value of things?</li>

<p>To see the Anchor in your Lenormand reading signals your tenacity at
reaching a goal or completing a task. Despite whatever setbacks or
tricky situations you find yourself in, you remain steadfast in your
choices. Something is giving you the strength and the stability to keep
you focused on your desires in the changing winds.</p>
<p>The solid focus that the anchor imparts can either be positive or
negative - on one hand it creates an environment of safety, but it can
also mean that you can become so inflexible that you cannot let go of
ideas, concepts or goals that are not really serving you. Whether the
anchor in your Lenormand reading becomes a positive or negative force is
something that is up to you, and how you choose to use it in the context
of your life.</p>

<p>While the Cross can be representative of organized religion, this
Lenormand card’s meaning can also be expanded to include the concepts of
ideology and responsibility - such as when we come across the phrase
“one’s cross to bear”. Ideologies direct our goals, our actions and our
values - they create a division between what is “good” and what is
“bad”. They tell us what we should do and what we should not do, and can
become incredibly harmful when taken to extremes. It is through
ideologies that we learn to judge others, and judge ourselves -
sometimes going too far and creating a culture of intolerance.</p>
<p>Because ideologies have value judgements, they become closely tied
with this Lenormand card’s other meanings. Sometimes what is considered
the “right” thing to do can drive us towards great accomplishments and
fulfillment, but it can also, especially in cases where those ideals and
principles are far too extreme, become a heavy burden. We cannot be
perfect creatures all the time, we are only human.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in life do I feel burdened?</li>
<li>What are my values and why?</li>
<li>What do I consider absolutes in my life?</li>
<li>Where am I being too judgemental?</li>
